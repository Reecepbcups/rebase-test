## Thoughts
- Is this the correct idea?
    - will prices in DEXs be confusing? is this something we can mitigate?
- ideally StockToken and WrappedToken would be interconnected (i.e. no need for duplicate ticker or price feed, point to the same object or share reference to the StockToken in Wrapped)
